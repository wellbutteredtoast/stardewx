# StardewX
<!-- Name is a WIP, may change at any notice! -->

> This mod assumes you've completed Stardew Valley at least once, spoilers beware!

This is the repository for StardewX, a *massive* content mod for Stardew Valley 1.6. This mod adds huge amounts of new content to Stardew Valley while adding lots of its own content on top of vanilla. This mod is aimed at players who love *extensive* and long playthroughs of games, players who can put multiple in-game years of work to see true perfection and completion. StardewX is also meant to feel very close to vanilla, when it comes to art-style and even music and sounds. This mod is a personal passion project, and is not perfect. If you come across bugs during gameplay, please report them via [**GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/wellbutteredtoast/stardewx/issues)!

Documentation is written with Markdown for formatting / style purposes, so reading it directly from this repository is recommended. Downloading for offline use will result in plain-text documentation that can be hard to read.

Installing StardewX is fairly straightforward. First things first, you will need all the pre-requisite mods installed beforehand. Below are all the mods that are absolutely **required** by StardewX to work.

### Pre-requisites
- MailFrameworkMod

All of these mods can be sourced from locations like Github, or Nexus Mods, or some other parts of the Internet. Once you have them installed and running, StardewX can be installed.

### Installing StardewX

After downloading the \*.zip file from either a mod hosting site or this repos [*Releases*]() page, extract the directory to your games `Mods` directory.

On Windows, this typically lives in: `\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Mods`\
For Linux: `steamapps/common/Stardew Valley/Mods`\
For MacOS: `??` <!-- idk -->

To find your `steamapps` directory you'll need to know where Steam is installed on your computer.

And that's it! StardewX is now installed into your game and it should work just fine from here on out.
